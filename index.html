						<h3><b>Basic Information</b></h3>
					</div>
					<div class="w3-container">
						<ul>
							<li>
								My name is Matthew Aird, i completed year 12 back in 2014. When i finished school i decided to take a little time off before jumping back in to schooling. The first course i attended was a remedial massage therapy course, instantly i realised that was not for me. so once i dropped out of that course, i decided to just work full time to save as much money as possible, until now.
							</li>
							<li>
								Looking back at when i was in school, this was not the course i thought i would end up committing to. Its been almost 6 years since i finished year 12, and back then my main goal was to do something sport science related. I have always loved the thought of most things IT though, creating a game that people such as myself love to play was always something i thought about. That is why i have chose this course, somewhere to start and put me in the right direction.
							</li>
							<li>
								The start of my interest into IT would have began probably around the time year 12 was coming to an end. Me and my friends would always talk about how cool it would be to create a game we all loved playing, and we always had these amazing ideas that we thought some games needed. To this day i still have those thoughts so that is one of the many reasons why i thought i should begin to follow those thoughts and actually do something about it.
							</li>
							<li>
								My brother was a big influence on why i decided to go through RMIT, he has previously studied here and i have heard nothing but good things so i thought RMIT would be a perfect fit. He also is a software engineer, so seeing him enjoy his work and be really passionate about it has intrigued me and inspired me to start my studies in IT and hopefully on to game development.
							</li>
							<li>
								Once this course has commenced, id like to continue on to the bachelor that could get me into the game development industry. Or even a graphics design job, both jobs are something i am very interested in. I am hoping this course will help me in starting my journey into these jobs.
							</li>
							<li>
								I have little IT experience apart from the standard Microsoft Word, excel etc. Growing up in a time where technology is a huge part of society definitely has its advantages, i feel like i can hopefully adjust and learn IT reasonably fast because of this.

						<ul>
							<li>
								This job application is for a Game Programmer position. Being a Game Programmer you are required to debug, analyse and implement code whilst working within a team. This job seems very fitting for me because it covers all my basis of interests, just being able to help create a game I would love playing and making would be special.
							</li>
							<li>
								There are a lot of skills and requirements needed for a job such as this. I would need a bachelors degree in either software engineering or computer science, experience in the video game industry, exceptional knowledge of c++, ability to work in a team and learn new skills quickly, standard knowledge of debugging tools and to be passionate about making and playing videos games.
							</li>
							<li>
								I do not really have any of the experience for this job but that is why i am studying here at RMIT, to get the basic knowledge and then some. To then also get the experience i need for such a job. being passionate about playing video games is something i have always had, and i feel like once i get the proper knowledge i would be passionate about making them as well. working within a team I have done my whole life, whether it was through sport or the various jobs i have worked for.
							</li>
							<li>
								My plan for getting a job of this calibre is to start right here, then begin a bachelors degree of software engineering or computer science. once i have completed that i would have to get a job working within a small indie company or even work for myself. after all the studying and experience in the game programming industry i should have enough qualifications and skills to hopefully get a job very similar to this one.

						<h3><b>SmartGlass Project</b></h3>
						<p>
							The smart glass is a easy and convenient drinking glass that allows an easier way for bartenders and waiters to know when their customers need another refill on their drink.
							It will even allow you to ask for assistance not only for your drinks but for any help you need from your waiter. You can change what drink you wish to request at any time, just press the middle button and of a signal goes, to let the waiters know you need assistance.
						</p>
						<p>The SmartGlass is very useful for waiters/waitresses and bartenders because it takes some of the stress away of always being rushed and constantly going back and forth between tables. Scientists have found that waiters and waitresses have a higher risk of a stroke than those with a low stress job by at least 22%. Miss hearing your customers request for a drink and accidently handing them the wrong drink is always stressful. The SmartGlass will help take that away by eliminating a huge factor is the miscommunication of ordering a drink. Making the job easier for the waiters/waitresses is essential for this item.
						</p>
						<h5><b>Features</b></h5>
					</div>
					<div class="w3-container">
						<ul>
							<li>The SmartGlass has 3 thin buttons on the bottom outter rim of the glass. The button furthest to the left is to request a refill of the same drink you ordered when you first arrived. The button in the middle is to request assistance, whether its to order more food, somethings wrong with the food or even if you would like to change the drink the your glass is set to. The button furthest to the right is to say no more drinks, this will stop the waiter/waitresses from coming to your table to ask if you want a refill when they see your glass is flashing red. </li>
							<li>When your glass flashes red it means the glass is empty, it helps waiters/waitresses know that your glass is empty and they you may need another. If you are not needing another drink just press the button furthest to the right. There are two other colours that your glass will imitate. Your glass will shine green, which means that your glass is full, there for you do not need another drink just yet. The last colour is yellow, this shows when your glass is roughly half full, in this case most waiters/waitresses will often come up and ask if you would like a refill. the lights are also just for show, and a cool little feature.</li>
							<li>Al though it is called a SmartGlass, its not actually made of glass. It is actually made of a firm thick plastic. This is for just incase it gets dropped, that way it wont shatter or crack.
								The waiter/waitresses have a monitor behind the bar. This is where all the data is recorded, it has the tables and the glasses on it, all showing what drinks go to what glasses. this also has the same colours that the SmartGlass has, showing whether a glass is full, half full, or empty. It also has a 'Tag' feature, this feature is incase a customer is too drunk and they have been cut off. it shuts off their light on the SmartGlass and also on the monitor with a sign that says 'Tagged'. This is to make sure that this person is not to drink an excessive amount.
							</li>
							<li>
								In most cases, when you order a drink through the SmartGlass, the waiter/waitress would have made the drink and then bring it to you, rather than taking your glass away and filling it up, this speeds up the request for your drink so you are not waiting an excessive amount of time.
								The SmartGlass is also waterproof, this allows for easy cleaning, and well, its a drinking glass, so it would have to be liquid proof.
							</li>
							<li>
								The last feature the SmartGlass has is a coaster, the coaster charges the glass whilst it is on top. the glass and coaster are connected by magnets to ensure that you do not knock over the glass.
							</li>
							<li>
								All this is able to work because these glasses would be powered by Arduinos, using Arduino water sensors and basic buttons. These arduinos would send the data to the raspberry pi via Wifi, which is the information that the waiters see on the touch panel monitor. The Arduino water sensor would send the information to the cloud, and the raspberry pi connected to the monitors would send a pull protocol, which pulls the information from the cloud and then said information would appear onto the monitors. a raspberry pi is a small device that plugs into a tv/monitor and acts like a computer, displaying and outputting information.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h5><b>Skills & Requirements</b></h5>
						<ul>
							<li>
								In order to create this project you would need a good knowledge of electronics as this project will require soldiering, electronic currents and charging, wireless charging circuits.
							</li>
							<li>
								You would also require the knowledge of Arduinos, raspberry pi tech and software programming.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h5><b>Tools & technologies</b></h5>
						<ul>
							<li>
								To complete this project you would need a manufacturer, someone who can construct the SmartGlass, if you can not do so yourself.
							</li>
							<li>
								In constructing the Arduinos, you would need a soldiering iron, wire, wire cutters, LED lights, water sensor, an Arduino and a raspberry pi.
							</li>
							<li>
								For the Raspberry pi side of the system you would need a raspberry pi with wifi capabilites and a touch screen
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h5><b>Outcomes</b></h5>
						<p>
							Overall the aim of this product is to make it a little easier for the customer and the waiter/waitress, making communication a little easier and more subtle. Takes the stress away from both parties, and hopefully reduces the stress of waiters/waitresses, there for the chances of strokes in that work area are also lower. Mental health is is also something this will help, stress takes its toll on everyone, reducing stress is key for any workplace. It is also a cool feature to have at your bar/pub or restaurant. It is sure to bring in more people for its appealing look and features. something new and impressive, a very good way of catching the eye of customers.

						<p>- I feel like these results are pretty accurate, when it comes to being in a team i would say i am not a leader if i do not have to be but if needed to be i would. i like to think these results say i am very neutral when it comes to most things, which i think is true.</p>

						<p>- - These results i also feel are pretty accurate, i am low in the Conscientiousness at the moment but that is something i am trying to change. i do get easily sidetracked, but i am trying to change it and i am hoping this course helps that. although it does not seem like a good trait to have in a team environment, i still feel with the mindset i am in right now i can be of much help in any team.</p>

						<h4><b>Vark Test</b></h4>
						<p>- These results show that i am more a hands on practical person when it comes to learning. I agree 100%, when it comes to learning i feel like i understand and learn the most efficiently when i am more hands on, rather than watching someone else do something i feel like i take more information in if i am doing the task myself and the person training me is just walking me through. This can be good in a team environment because it means i am not shy of the practical side of things, and i am willing to learn new things to help the team hands on.
