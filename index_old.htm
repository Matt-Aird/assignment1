<h1>Profile of Matt Aird</h1>
<h2> Basic Information About Myself </h2>
<p>My name is Matthew Aird, i completed year 12 back in 2014. When
i finshed school i decided to take a little time off before jumping
back
in to schooling. The first course i attended was a remmedial massage
therapy course, instantly i realised that wasnt for me. so once i dropped
out of that course, i decided to just work full time to save as much
money as possible, until now.
</p>
<p>
Looking back at when i was in school, this 
was not the course i thought i would end up committing to. Its been
almost 6 years since i finished year 12, and back then my main goal
was to do
something sport science related. ive always loved the thought of most
things IT though, creating a game that people such as myself love to
play was
always something i thought about. Thats why i have chosen this course,
somewhere to start and put me in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
The start of my interest into IT wouldve began probably around the time year
12 was coming to an end. Me and my friends would always talk about
how cool it would be to create a game we all loved playing, and we always had
these amazing ideas that we thought some games needed. To this day
i still have those thoughts so thats one of the many reasons why i thought i
should begin to follow those thoughts and actually do something about it.
</p>
<p>
My brother was a big influence on why i decided to go through RMIT, he has previosuly
studied here and ive heard nothing but good things so i thought
RMIT would be a perfect fit. He also is a software engineer, so seeing him enjoy his
work and be really passionate about it has entrigued me and
inspired me to start my studies in IT and hopefully on to game development.
</p>
<p>
Once this course has comenced, id like to continue on to the bachelor that could get
me into the game development industry. Or even a graphics design
job, both jobs are something i am very interested in. I am hoping this course will
help me in starting my journey into these jobs.
I have little IT experience apart from the standard Microsoft Word, excel etc. Growing
up in a time where technology is a huge part
of society definitely has its advantages, i feel like i can hopefully adjust and learn
IT reasonably fast because of this.
</p>

<h2> Ideal job </h2>
<p>
This job applicationg is for a Game Programmer position. Being a Game Programmer you are 
required to debug, analyse and implement code whilst working within a team. This job seems 
very fitting for me because it covers all my basis of interests, just being able to help 
create a game I would love playing and making would be special.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of skills and requirements needed for a job such as this. I would need a 
bachelors degree in either software engineering or computer science, experience in the video
game industry, exceptional knowledge of c++, ability to work in a team and learn new skills 
quickly, standard knowledge of debugging tools and to be passionate about making and playing 
videos games.
</p>
<p>
I dont really have any of the experience for this job but thats why i am studying here at RMIT,
to get the basic knowledge and some, to then get the experince i need for such a job. being passionate
about playing video games is something ive always had, and i feel like once i get the proper knowledge
i would be passionate about making them as well. working within a team I have done my whole life,
whether it was through sport or the varioous jobs i have worked for.
</p>
<p>
My plan for getting a job of this calibre is to start right here, then begin a bachelors degree
of software engineering or computer science. once i have completed that i would have to get a job
working within a small indy company or even work for myself. after all the studying and experience
in the game programming industry i should have enough qualifications and skills to hopefully get a
job very similar to this one.

<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
<p>
- I feel like these results are pretty accurate, when it comes to being in a team i would say im
 not a leader if i dont have to be but if needed to be i would. i like to think these results say
 im very neutral when it comes to most things, which i think is true.
</p>
<h3>Big 5 Personailty Test</h3>
<p>
- These results i also feel are pretty accurate, im low in the Conscienctiousness at the moment
 but that is something i am trying to change. i do get easily sidetracked, but im rtying to cahnge
 it and im hoping this course helps that. although it doesnt seem like a good trait to have in a
 team environment, i still feel with the mindset im in right now i can be of much help in any team.

<h1>SmartGlass Project</h1>
<p>
The smart glass is an easy and convenient drinking glass that allows an easier way for bartenders
 and waiters to know when their customers need another refill on their drink.
It will even allow you to ask for assistance not only for your drinks but for any help you need
 from your waiter.
</p>
<p>
The SmartGlass is very useful for waiters/waitresses and bartenders because it takes some of the
 stress away of always being rushed and constantly going back and forth between tables. Scientists
 have found that waiters and waitresses have a higher risk of a stroke than those with a low stress
 job by at least 22%. Miss hearing your customers request for a drink and accidently  hand. With the
 SmartGlass we have tried to take that away and you will understand how further below.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
-The SmartGlass has 3 thin buttons on the bottom out rim of the glass. The button furthest to the
 left is to request a refill of the same drink you ordered when you first arrived. The button in
 the middle is to request assistance, whether its to order more food, somethings wrong with the
 food or even if you would like to change the drink the your glass is set to. The button furthest
 to the right is to say no more drinks, this will stop the waiter/waitresses from coming to your
 table to ask if you want a refill when they see your glass is flashing red. When your glass flashes
 red it means the glass is empty, it helps waiters/waitresses know that your glass is empty and they
 you may need another. If you are not needing another drink just press the button furthest to the
 right. There are two other colours that your glass will imitate. Your glass will shine green, which
 means that your glass is full, there for you do not need another drink just yet. The last colour
 is yellow, this shows when your glass is roughly half full, in this case most waiters/waitresses
 will often come up and ask if you would like a refill. the lights are also just for show, and a
 cool little feature.
</p>
<p>
-Al though it is called a SmartGlass, its not actually made of glass. It is actually made of a firm
 thick plastic. This is for just incase it gets dropped, that way it wont shatter or crack.
The waiter/waitresses have a monitor behind the bar. This is where all the data is recorded, it has
 the tables and the glasses on it, all showing what drinks go to what glasses. this also has the same
 colours that the SmartGlass has, showing whether a glass is full, half full, or empty. It also has a
 'Tag' feature, this feature is incase a customer is too drunk and they have been cut off. it shuts off
 their light on the SmartGlass and also on the monitor whit a sign that says 'Tagged'. This is to
 make sure that this person is to drink an excessive amount, and to help stop any violence that may
 occur.
</p>
<p>
-In most cases, when you order a drink through the SmartGlass, the waiter/waitress would have made the
 drink and then bring it to you, rather than taking your glass away and filling it up, this speeds up
 the request for your drink so you are not waiting an excessive amount of time.
The SmartGlass is also waterproof, this allows for easy cleaning, and well, its a drinking glass, so
 it would have to be liquid proof.
</p>
<p>
Overall the aim of this product is to make it a little easier for the customer and the waiter/waitress,
 making communication a little easier and more subtle. Takes the stress away from both parties, and
 hopefully reduces the stress of waiters/waitresses, there for the chances of strokes in that work
 area are also lower. It is also a cool feature to have at your bar/pub or restaurant.
